### **üîå INTEGRATION STRATEGY FOR MEDSIGHT-PRO**

#### **1. Leverage Shared UI Components & Design System**

**üé® CRITICAL: Follow @UIUX.md Design System**
All frontend development MUST adhere to the comprehensive **G3DAI Universal Design System 2.0** documented in `@/docs/UIUX.md`.

**MedSight Pro Specific Design Requirements:**
```typescript
// Use shared UI with MedSight Pro design system compliance
import { 
  GlassCard, 
  GlassButton, 
  Modal, 
  Progress,
  Tabs,
  Badge
} from '@/shared/components/ui';

// REQUIRED: MedSight Pro Brand Identity (from UIUX.md)
const medsightColors = {
  primary: '#0ea5e9',      // Medical Blue - Trust, healthcare, precision
  secondary: '#10b981',    // Medical Green - Health, safety, positive outcomes  
  accent: '#f59e0b',       // Medical Gold - Premium, accuracy, clinical excellence
  normal: '#10b981',       // Normal findings
  abnormal: '#ef4444',     // Abnormal findings
  pending: '#f59e0b',      // Pending review
  critical: '#dc2626',     // Critical findings
  aiHigh: '#059669',       // 90%+ AI confidence
  aiMedium: '#d97706',     // 70-90% AI confidence
  aiLow: '#dc2626'         // <70% AI confidence
};

// REQUIRED: Use MedSight Pro Glass Effects (from UIUX.md)
import './styles/medsight-glass.css'; // Contains .medsight-glass, .medsight-viewer-glass, etc.

// Example: Medical study viewer with MedSight Pro glassmorphism
<div className="medsight-glass">
  <h3 className="text-medsight-primary">DICOM Study: {studyName}</h3>
  <Progress 
    value={loadingProgress} 
    variant="success" 
    className="medsight-confidence-high"
  />
</div>

// REQUIRED: Medical-specific authentication with MedSight design
<div className="medsight-glass max-w-md mx-auto">
  <h2 className="text-medsight-primary">MedSight Pro - Medical Login</h2>
  <Input 
    placeholder="Email or Medical License" 
    className="glass-input medsight-input"
  />
  <Button className="btn-medsight">Sign In</Button>
</div>
```

**Design System Compliance Checklist:**
- [ ] Use MedSight Pro color palette (`--medsight-primary-*` variables)
- [ ] Implement MedSight Pro glass effects (`.medsight-glass`, `.medsight-viewer-glass`)  
- [ ] Follow medical typography guidelines (enhanced readability)
- [ ] Use medical status colors for findings (normal, abnormal, critical)
- [ ] Implement AI confidence indicators (high, medium, low)
- [ ] Follow medical-grade accessibility standards
- [ ] Use medical-themed UI patterns from UIUX.md

#### **2. Integrate Infrastructure Engines**
```typescript
// Use enterprise memory management for medical volumes
import { MemoryManager } from '@/infrastructure/engines';

// Extend for medical-specific needs
export class MedicalMemoryManager extends MemoryManager {
  async allocateDICOMVolume(studyId: string, dimensions: [number, number, number]) {
    const size = dimensions[0] * dimensions[1] * dimensions[2] * 4; // 32-bit floats
    return this.allocate(size, 'gpu', 16); // 16-byte alignment for GPU
  }
  
  async allocateStudyBuffer(studyId: string, seriesCount: number) {
    const bufferSize = seriesCount * 512 * 512 * 4; // Estimate per series
    return this.allocate(bufferSize, 'cpu');
  }
}

// Use real-time analytics for medical metrics
import { RealTimeAnalytics } from '@/infrastructure/engines';

const medicalAnalytics = new RealTimeAnalytics();
medicalAnalytics.ingestDataPoint({
  source: 'dicom-processor',
  type: 'numeric',
  value: processingTime,
  tags: ['medical', 'dicom', 'performance']
});
```

#### **3. Connect to Shared Authentication**
```typescript
// Replace custom auth with shared enterprise service
import { AuthService } from '@/shared/auth/AuthService';

const authService = new AuthService({
  serviceId: 'medsight-pro',
  apiUrl: 'https://auth.g3d.ai',
  storage: { type: 'local', encrypt: true },
  session: { timeout: 60, renewThreshold: 15 },
  logging: { level: 'info' }
});

// Medical-specific user context
interface MedicalUser extends User {
  medicalLicense: string;
  specialization: string[];
  hospitalAffiliations: string[];
  accessLevel: 'resident' | 'attending' | 'radiologist' | 'admin';
}

// Authentication page components using shared UI
const LoginPage = () => {
  return (
    <GlassCard variant="primary" className="max-w-md mx-auto">
      <h2>MedSight Pro - Medical Login</h2>
      <Input placeholder="Email or Medical License" />
      <Input type="password" placeholder="Password" />
      <Button onClick={() => authService.login()}>Sign In</Button>
      <Button variant="ghost" onClick={() => router.push('/signup')}>
        New User? Sign Up
      </Button>
    </GlassCard>
  );
};

const SignUpPage = () => {
  return (
    <GlassCard variant="primary" className="max-w-lg mx-auto">
      <h2>Create MedSight Pro Account</h2>
      <Input placeholder="Full Name" />
      <Input placeholder="Email Address" />
      <Input placeholder="Medical License Number" />
      <Select placeholder="Specialization">
        <option>Radiology</option>
        <option>Cardiology</option>
        <option>Oncology</option>
      </Select>
      <Input placeholder="Hospital/Organization" />
      <Checkbox>I agree to HIPAA compliance terms</Checkbox>
      <Button onClick={() => authService.register()}>Create Account</Button>
    </GlassCard>
  );
};
```

#### **4. Use Shared API Gateway & Services**
```typescript
// Leverage existing gateway for medical services
import { APIGateway } from '@/shared/api-client/api-gateway';

// Medical services already configured in gateway
const medicalServices = {
  visionPro: '/api/vision-pro',      // Medical image analysis
  healthAI: '/api/health-ai',        // Clinical AI models

  customMetrics: {
    studiesProcessed: totalStudies,
    volumeRenderingFPS: renderingFPS,
    memoryUsageGB: gpuMemoryUsage / 1024
  }
});

// Connect to shared billing for medical usage tracking
