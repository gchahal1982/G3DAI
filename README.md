## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- TypeScript 5+
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- Kubernetes (for production deployment)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gchahal1982/G3DAI.git
cd G3DAI

# Install shared dependencies
npm install

# Install dependencies for a specific AI platform
cd ai-platforms/[platform-name]
npm install
```

### Development
```bash
# Start a specific AI platform
cd ai-platforms/[platform-name]
npm run dev

# Start backend services
cd backend
npm run dev

# Start shared services
cd shared
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 Key Features

### Unified Architecture
- **Consistent Structure**: All AI platforms follow the same organizational pattern
- **Shared Components**: Common UI elements and utilities across platforms
- **Microservices**: Each platform is independently deployable
- **Scalable Design**: Built for enterprise-scale deployment

### Advanced AI Capabilities
- **Multi-Modal AI**: Support for text, image, video, and audio processing
- **Real-time Processing**: Live data processing and analysis
- **3D Visualization**: Advanced 3D rendering and visualization
- **Enterprise Security**: Built-in security and compliance features

### Developer Experience
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support with strict typing
- **Modern Stack**: React, Next.js, Node.js, and modern web technologies
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Beautiful, modern user interface design
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and e2e testing

## 📖 Organization Principles

1. **Clean Separation**: AI platforms are separated from shared infrastructure
2. **No Prefixes**: Removed `g3d-` prefixes for cleaner naming
3. **Merged Duplicates**: Combined duplicate implementations intelligently
4. **Shared Dependencies**: Common utilities centralized in `/shared` and `/src`
5. **Scalable Structure**: Designed for easy addition of new AI platforms

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Adding a New AI Platform
1. Create directory in `/ai-platforms/[platform-name]/`
2. Follow the standard structure with `src/`, `package.json`, etc.
3. Use shared components from `/shared/ui/`
4. Integrate with backend services in `/backend/`
5. Add documentation and tests

### Modifying Shared Components
1. Update components in `/shared/ui/`
2. Test across multiple AI platforms
3. Update documentation and version numbers
4. Deploy shared services first, then dependent platforms

## 🚢 Deployment

### Development
```bash
# Start all services in development mode
npm run dev:all

# Start specific platform
npm run dev:platform [platform-name]
```

### Production
```bash
# Build all platforms
npm run build:all

# Deploy to Kubernetes
kubectl apply -f deployment/kubernetes/

# Deploy with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
```

## 📊 Status

- **Total AI Platforms**: 24+
- **Shared Components**: Fully integrated
- **Backend Services**: Production-ready
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive
- **Testing**: In progress
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes-ready
